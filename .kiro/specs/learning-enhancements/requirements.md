# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the FluentFlow learning application by implementing key improvements identified through competitive analysis with leading language learning platforms (Duolingo, Babbel, Memrise, Busuu). The enhancements focus on improving user engagement, learning effectiveness, and content quality while leveraging the existing robust architecture.

The improvements are designed to be implemented incrementally without requiring major architectural changes, utilizing existing components, stores, and data structures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Content Quality

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want more detailed explanations and contextual information in exercises, so that I can better understand grammar rules and usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a completion exercise THEN the system SHALL display detailed explanations that include grammar rules and usage context
2. WHEN a user views a flashcard THEN the system SHALL provide contextual tips and memory aids beyond basic translations
3. WHEN a user answers incorrectly THEN the system SHALL show comprehensive feedback with learning hints
4. IF an exercise involves grammar concepts THEN the system SHALL include pattern recognition tips and common mistake warnings

### Requirement 2: Daily Challenge System

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want a daily challenge that combines different learning modes, so that I can maintain consistent study habits and experience varied practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the app each day THEN the system SHALL present a unique daily challenge combining 3-5 different learning modes
2. WHEN a user completes a daily challenge THEN the system SHALL award bonus points and track streak progress
3. WHEN generating daily challenges THEN the system SHALL select content appropriate to the user's current level and progress
4. IF a user misses a day THEN the system SHALL reset the streak counter but preserve the challenge availability
5. WHEN a daily challenge is completed THEN the system SHALL unlock the next day's challenge

### Requirement 3: Visual Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to see visual representations of my learning progress, so that I can stay motivated and understand my strengths and areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their progress THEN the system SHALL display visual charts showing accuracy trends over time
2. WHEN a user completes modules THEN the system SHALL update progress bars showing completion percentage by level (A1-C2)
3. WHEN a user accesses the progress section THEN the system SHALL show module completion status with visual indicators
4. IF a user has completed multiple sessions THEN the system SHALL display performance analytics including time spent and improvement trends
5. WHEN viewing progress THEN the system SHALL highlight achievements and milestones reached

### Requirement 4: Gamification and Achievement System

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to earn points and badges for my learning activities, so that I feel motivated and rewarded for consistent study.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user answers correctly THEN the system SHALL award points based on difficulty and accuracy
2. WHEN a user completes a module THEN the system SHALL award completion bonuses and update total score
3. WHEN a user reaches point milestones THEN the system SHALL unlock achievement badges
4. IF a user studies consecutively THEN the system SHALL track and reward study streaks
5. WHEN a user views their profile THEN the system SHALL display earned badges, total points, and current streak
6. WHEN calculating points THEN the system SHALL consider factors like difficulty level, time taken, and accuracy percentage

### Requirement 5: Thematic Learning Paths

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to follow themed learning paths that group related content, so that I can focus on specific topics relevant to my goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user browses learning content THEN the system SHALL organize modules into thematic paths (Business, Travel, Daily Life, Academic)
2. WHEN a user selects a thematic path THEN the system SHALL show a curated sequence of related modules across different learning modes
3. WHEN a user completes modules in a path THEN the system SHALL track thematic progress separately from overall progress
4. IF a user is following a thematic path THEN the system SHALL recommend the next logical module in that theme
5. WHEN viewing thematic paths THEN the system SHALL display estimated completion time and difficulty level

### Requirement 6: Micro-Learning Sessions

**User Story:** As a busy language learner, I want short, focused learning sessions of 5-10 minutes, so that I can study effectively even with limited time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects micro-learning THEN the system SHALL create sessions lasting 5-10 minutes with mixed content types
2. WHEN generating micro-sessions THEN the system SHALL combine 2-3 different learning modes for variety
3. WHEN a user completes a micro-session THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and progress updates
4. IF a user has limited time THEN the system SHALL prioritize high-impact content based on spaced repetition algorithms
5. WHEN creating micro-sessions THEN the system SHALL ensure content difficulty matches user's current level

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Spaced Repetition

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want the system to intelligently schedule review of previously learned content, so that I can improve long-term retention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes content THEN the system SHALL schedule future reviews based on performance and difficulty
2. WHEN a user struggles with content THEN the system SHALL increase review frequency for that material
3. WHEN a user demonstrates mastery THEN the system SHALL extend review intervals appropriately
4. IF review content is due THEN the system SHALL prioritize it in daily challenges and micro-sessions
5. WHEN calculating review schedules THEN the system SHALL use spaced repetition algorithms considering ease factor and interval timing
