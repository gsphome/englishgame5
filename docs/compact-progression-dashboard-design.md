# Compact Progression Dashboard Design

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
The progression dashboard was excessively long with 48 modules across 6 units, creating poor UX with excessive scrolling and loss of overview.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Solution: Collapsible Unit System

### Key Features Implemented:

#### 1. **Collapsible Units**
- Units are collapsed by default, showing only essential info
- Click to expand/collapse individual units
- Smooth slide-down animation for expanded content

#### 2. **Smart Auto-Expansion**
- Units containing the "next recommended" module auto-expand
- Ensures users always see their next step without manual interaction

#### 3. **Visual Hierarchy Improvements**
- **Unit Headers**: Clickable with hover effects and expand/collapse icons
- **Progress Indicators**: Compact progress bars with completion stats
- **Next Module Indicators**: Clear "Next" badges on relevant units
- **Completion Status**: Green checkmark icons for completed units

#### 4. **Compact Information Display**
- Unit stats show "X/Y" format instead of verbose text
- Essential module info preserved when expanded
- Reduced vertical spacing throughout

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation
