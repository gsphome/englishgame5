# Menu Context Navigation Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a navigation system that remembers which menu context users came from when entering learning modes, allowing them to return to the correct view (Progression Dashboard or All Modules List) when exiting learning modes.

## Problem Solved
Previously, when users exited learning modes (flashcards, quiz, completion, sorting, matching), they always returned to the main menu with the default view. This created a poor UX where users lost their navigation context.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Type System Updates
**File**: `src/types/index.ts`
- Added `MenuContext` type: `'progression' | 'list'`
- Extended `AppState` interface with `previousMenuContext: MenuContext`

### 2. Store Enhancement
**File**: `src/stores/appStore.ts`
- Added `previousMenuContext` state (defaults to 'progression')
- Added `setPreviousMenuContext` action
- Persisted `previousMenuContext` in localStorage for session continuity

### 3. Custom Navigation Hook
**File**: `src/hooks/useMenuNavigation.ts`
- Created `useMenuNavigation()` hook that encapsulates navigation logic
- Provides `returnToMenu()` function that respects previous context
- Returns `previousMenuContext` for components that need it

### 4. Context Tracking
**Files**: 
- `src/components/ui/MainMenu.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/ProgressionDashboard.tsx`

**MainMenu Updates**:
- Initializes view mode based on `previousMenuContext`
- Saves current view mode as context before navigating to learning modes
- Syncs view mode with stored context when component mounts

**ProgressionDashboard Updates**:
- Sets context to 'progression' when navigating to learning modes
- Ensures users return to progression view when coming from there

### 5. Learning Component Updates
**Files**: All learning components updated
- `src/components/learning/FlashcardComponent.tsx`
- `src/components/learning/QuizComponent.tsx`
- `src/components/learning/CompletionComponent.tsx`
- `src/components/learning/SortingComponent.tsx`
- `src/components/learning/MatchingComponent.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Replaced direct `setCurrentView('menu')` calls with `returnToMenu()`
- Updated useEffect dependencies to use new hook
- Removed unused `useAppStore` imports where applicable

### 6. Header Component Update
**File**: `src/components/ui/Header.tsx`
- Updated to use `useMenuNavigation` hook for consistent navigation behavior

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: User from Progression Dashboard
1. User is in MainMenu with "Progress" view active
2. User clicks on a module → context saved as 'progression'
3. User completes/exits learning mode → returns to MainMenu with "Progress" view active

### Scenario 2: User from All Modules List
1. User is in MainMenu with "All Modules" view active
2. User clicks on a module → context saved as 'list'
3. User completes/exits learning mode → returns to MainMenu with "All Modules" view active

### Scenario 3: Direct Navigation from Progression Dashboard
1. User clicks "Continue Learning" or module in ProgressionDashboard
2. Context automatically set to 'progression'
3. User exits → returns to MainMenu with "Progress" view active

## Technical Benefits

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Navigation logic centralized in custom hook
- Components don't need to know about menu contexts
- Easy to test and maintain

### 2. Persistence
- Context survives page refreshes via localStorage
- Consistent experience across sessions

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to existing components

### 4. Performance
- Minimal overhead (single state variable)
- No additional API calls or complex logic

## Testing
- Created comprehensive tests for `useMenuNavigation` hook
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Type checking passes without errors
- Build process successful with proper React bundling

## Code Quality
- Follows established patterns in the codebase
- Uses TypeScript for type safety
- Maintains BEM CSS architecture
- Follows React best practices with custom hooks

## Future Enhancements
This foundation enables future improvements like:
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Deep linking with context preservation
- Analytics tracking of navigation patterns
- More granular context tracking (e.g., search queries, filters)
